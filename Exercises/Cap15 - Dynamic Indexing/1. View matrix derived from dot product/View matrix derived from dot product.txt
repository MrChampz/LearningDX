1. Given the world space axes and origin in world coordinates:

i = (1, 0, 0)
j = (0, 1, 0)
k = (0, 0, 1)
O = (0, 0, 0)

and the view space axes and origin in world coordinates:

U = (Ux, Uy, Uz)
V = (Vx, Vy, Vz)
W = (Wx, Wy, Wz)
Q = (Qx, Qy, Qz)

derive the view matrix form:

       |   Ux       Vx       Wx     0 |
Vmat = |   Uy       Vy       Wy     0 |
       |   Uz       Vz       Wz     0 |
       | -Q * U   -Q * V   -Q * W   1 |

using the dot product. (Remember, to find the change of
coordinate matrix from world space to view space, you just
need to describe the world space axes and origin with
coordinates relative to view space. Then these coordinates
become the rows of the view matrix.)

* All the given vectors have coordinates in world space,
* and all the axis vectors are unit vectors. 

[I]v = [I * U   I * V   I * W]
     = [Ux   Vx   Wx]

[J]v = [J * U   J * V   J * W]
     = [Uy   Vy   Wy]

[K]v = [K * U   K * V   K * W]
     = [Uz   Vz   Wz]

[O]v = [(O - Q) * U   (O - Q) * V   (O - Q) * W]
     = [-Q * U   -Q * V   -Q * W]

Augmenting to homogeneous coordinates and putting these
vectors into the rows of a matrix yields the view matrix.

       | I |   |   Ux       Vx       Wx     0 |
Vmat = | J | = |   Uy       Vy       Wy     0 |
       | K |   |   Uz       Vz       Wz     0 |
       | Q |   | -Q * U   -Q * V   -Q * W   1 |
